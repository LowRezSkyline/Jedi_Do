# Jedi_Do
Jedi ToDo and Do Not Do List!

There is no try - Do or Do Not Do!

Since there are many TODO samplle apps online I wanted to create something unique / different. 

It's basicallly a simple TODO app, but you have two types of ToDos - Do's And Do Not Does. 

Examples include:
- Do! Talk to Yoda
- Do not Do! Kiss Chewy
- Do! Practice Light-Sabering

The app will run with an In-Memory database as is. 

To Enable SQL db persistance, update the Startup.cs; there are instructions in there.

Concepts demostrated:
- Basic CRUD functionality (R,W,U,D)
- Ability to mark a Todo Completed
- Persist data to in-memory db or SQL Database (see Startup.cs).
- Dependency Injection
- Design Patterns (Factory Pattern)
- Web-API / REST Endpoints
- PostMan Collection to test Get, Get/id/ Post, Put and Delete
- Vanilla JS 'Modern Ux' (Bootstrap v4)
